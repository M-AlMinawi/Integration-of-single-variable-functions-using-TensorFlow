# Integration-of-single-variable-functions-using-TensorFlow
Bachelor's project at the University of Zurich

Implementation of seven single variable integration algorithms using Tensorflow.

Testing code found in "testing code.exe" storing result, run-time, number of iterations when possible and number of evaluations for adaptive trapezoidal and adaptive Simpson's method.

The individual algorithms can be found in separate files titled according to the method.

Plots and data files from three rounds of testing are available with more planned for the future.
